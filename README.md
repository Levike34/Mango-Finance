I am launching a full-fledged financial platform with its own native token (Mango).

HOW It WORKS:
1. Stake Mango (MANG).  Your interest rate will be calculated based on the amount of MANGO staked.  Users receive an exact amount of Mango Juice (MJUS) to represent their stake.
2. Users earn interest in Manjo Juice (MJUS), calculated by the start time since staking, and rewards accumulate based on staked Mango and interest rate.
3. Users collect the reward in Mango Juice; the user now has more Mango Juice token than Mango.
4. When a user unstakes their Mango, their Mango Juice is burned by an equal number according to their Mango Stake size.  So, if a user has 100 Mango staked, and 150 Mango Juice,
   they can unstake 100 Mango and will have 50 Mango Juice leftover as their total earnings.

This staking platform can use any Native Token in place of Mango, and ideally the Farming token should have utility, such as games, liquidity pools for yield, etc.

Liquidity pools and games are coming soon to add momentum and utility to MangoSugar's native currency.
